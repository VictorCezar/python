# Data Science and Machine Learning Studies with Python

This repository contains materials and projects aimed at studying Data Science and Machine Learning with Python. It includes:

- Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for exploring various machine learning algorithms (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, neural networks, etc.).
- Data preprocessing techniques, such as handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
- Practical examples using libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`,  `PyTorch`, `TensorFlow` and `seaborn`. 
- Detailed explanations and documentation for each project, focusing on understanding the steps involved in building, training, and evaluating machine learning models.
- Case studies and datasets used to apply machine learning techniques to real-world problems.
